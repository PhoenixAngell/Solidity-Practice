# Solidity-Practice
A collection of Solidity projects created for practice only <br><br>
These files are a collection of projects created during my beginner months of blockchain development.
They are NOT intended to be used as production level dApps in any way.
They are intended purely as practice for working with Solidity smart contract logic.
